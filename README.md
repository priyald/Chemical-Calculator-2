Can be used to calculate different chemical formulas after taking user input.

<h2>How to Use?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Starting from the main file -> "Calc.py"</li>
  <li>The welcome page will give you the options to calculate 9 different formulas (Buffer pH, Activation Energy, Freezing Point Depression, Boiling Point Elevation, Ionic Strength, Beer Lambert Law, Molarity, Rate Constant, Standard Free Energy).</li>
  <li>Click on their corresponding buttons will lead you to a seperate tab.</li>
  <li>Enter user input. Press calculate to get the answer in the frame below.</li>
  <li>To close the tab click on the cross button in the upper-right corner.</li>
  <li>You can open as many tabs as you want.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Special Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use the entry "10^" to enter very large or very small datas. The default value is 0.</li>
  <li>In the "Ionic Strength" tab, you can add the input of as many ions you want for the same solution (even if you've already hit calculate). To start again, hit the calculate and then the restart button.</li>
  <li>In the "Standard Free Energy" tab, both Equilibrium Constant and Standard Free Energy can be calculated by entering their counterpart. Inputing both is not allowed.</li>
